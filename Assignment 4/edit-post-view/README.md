Sample shortcode 

Add a new shortcode which will display 10 latest post title with view counts by default. 
shortcode needs to be customizable eg: user can specify number of post to display, sort post title by view count (asc/desc), 
can specify a specific category and can enter post ids.

[latest-post-view-number]
[latest-post-view-number post_id="107"]
[latest-post-view-number category_name="Category six"]
